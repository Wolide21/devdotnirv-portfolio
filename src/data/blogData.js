    content:
      `Crafting a personal portfolio isn’t just about listing skills — it’s about storytelling. I developed this site using React for its component-based architecture and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development. The design is clean, responsive, and optimized for performance, with dark mode support and smooth transitions. I implemented reusable components like a project grid, blog post system, and contact form to streamline development and future scalability.`,

    content:
      `In this project, I engineered a serverless backend for uploading files directly to Amazon S3 using Python. Lambda functions were triggered on upload events to log metadata in CloudWatch. This reduced backend load and enabled scalable, pay-per-use infrastructure. I learned how to securely manage IAM roles, handle event-driven architecture, and apply DevOps practices using AWS’s CI/CD ecosystem.`,
